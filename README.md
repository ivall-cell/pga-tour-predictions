# Predicting PGA Tour Listings using ML and applying to Fantasy League

For my final year project I explored the vast amount of ShotLink data that the PGA Tour offer to academics.
Looking for trends and features of the data that would help predict the final listings of the tournaments.
I applied multiple ML methods and used various types of feature extraction to find the best variables that affect the winners of Golf competitions.

Unfortunately, my HDD was corrupted and I lost all my R and python scripts I used to complete this project and the only remaining
work I have is the final report.
